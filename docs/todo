- mask action: dash movement -> move multiple squares in a line
- mask action: fly power (winged) -> enable a number of steps (moving or still) without most collisions
- mask action: invisiblity -> enable number of steps without enemy viz
- mask action: slide movement -> move until hitting an object
- mask action: teleport movement -> random teleport movement, levelled up into directional (with small random vars)
